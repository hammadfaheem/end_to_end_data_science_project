# End-to-End Data Science Project Template

This repository provides a comprehensive template for building an end-to-end data science project. It includes everything needed to develop, deploy, and maintain a machine learning model, from data ingestion to deployment and monitoring. The project follows best practices for CI/CD and containerization, ensuring a scalable and reproducible workflow.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Automated pipelines for extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Modular scripts for cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Scalable training scripts with hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and versioning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Robust evaluation metrics, visualizations, and performance reports.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment setup using GitHub Actions.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized environment for deploying models as REST APIs, batch processing, or streaming.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integrated monitoring tools for tracking model performance and data drift over time.
- **Setup & Installation**: `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` for easy installation of dependencies.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with examples and usage guides.
